  abstract: A common system-theoretic problem for critical nonlinear dynamical systems
    such as aerospace systems is the estimation of the region of attraction. A well
    known approach to the problem relies on Lyapunov functions and invariant sets.
    Several strategies using sum-of-squares relaxations and semi-algebraic optimizations
    have been proposed, but a comparison of those strategies on benchmark problems
    and a detailed characterization is lacking. Properties such as convergence, robustness
    to initial guesses, computational issues and scalability have not been studied
    in a clear way. So in this thesis, a set of problems is presented which builds
    up a proposed test bench where different algorithms are to be characterized, compared
    and tested, and where all those properties can be extracted. Results from the
    most known and recent algorithms in the literature are presented as an application
    of the test bench, alongside a new proposal involving the use of two adaptive
    shape functions. Additionally, a proposal to estimate the region of attraction
    through an iterative sum-of-squares approach is presented but in contrast with
    the current literature, it is not based on Lyapunov theory but instead on the
    Bendixson-Dulac criterion for planar dynamics and set invariance. Also, extensions
    for higher dimensional systems are presented and discussed.
