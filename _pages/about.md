<!-- <h2 class="news-title-heading"> About me </h2> -->

<div class="news-content" style="text-align: justify;">
I’m <strong>Renato</strong>, a researcher driven by a deep interest in the intersection of control theory, safety, and autonomy in aerospace systems. I am currently a Research Associate at the <a href="https://www.ifr.uni-stuttgart.de/">Institute of Flight Mechanics and Controls</a> (iFR) at the University of Stuttgart, where I work under the supervision of <a href="https://www.ifr.uni-stuttgart.de/institut/team/Fichter/">Prof. Dr.-Ing. Walter Fichter</a> and <a href="https://www.ifr.uni-stuttgart.de/en/institute/team/Cunis/">Dr. Torbj&oslash;rn Cunis</a>. My research focuses on cooperative guidance strategies and robust control for autonomous aerial systems operating in uncertain and dynamic environments.
  <br><br>
  My work integrates tools from optimal control, robust optimization, and multi-agent systems to enable safe and efficient coordination in uncertain and dynamic environments. I am especially interested in bridging theory and practice to support decision-making and autonomy in future aerospace applications.
  <br><br>
  Before joining iFR, I obtained my M.Sc. in Aerospace Engineering from the University of Lisbon (<a href="https://tecnico.ulisboa.pt/en/">Instituto Superior Técnico</a>), specializing in flight dynamics and control. During my studies, I contributed to international research collaborations and gained hands-on experience in autonomous systems and flight control technologies.
