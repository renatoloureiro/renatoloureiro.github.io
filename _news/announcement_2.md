I earned my M.Sc. in Avionics from [Instituto Superior TÃ©cnico](https://tecnico.ulisboa.pt/en/) (University of Lisbon), where I completed my master's thesis titled [*Analysis and Comparison of Iterative Bilinear Sum-of-Squares Region of Attraction Estimation Algorithms*](https://scholar.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/records/iaM1bppeDhCY0kvTdA-5kf6Y7DyRUykzmChc). My research was conducted under the supervision of [Torbj&oslash;rn Cunis](https://www.ifr.uni-stuttgart.de/institut/team/Cunis/) and [Rita Cunha](https://scholar.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/authors/82ac9ada40e9da3bc278057ca72a2d46b8371b61051163444618752ac08c0519/records).
