I attended the [2025 American Control Conference](https://acc2025.a2c2.org/) between July 08-10, 2025, where I presented our work (with [Torbj&oslash;rn Cunis](https://www.ifr.uni-stuttgart.de/institut/team/Cunis/)) about estimation of robust regions of attraction and synthesis of polynomial observers.
