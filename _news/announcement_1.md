I attended the 2025 AIAA Scitech Forum held between January 06-10, 2025. There I presented our work on [real-time cooperative target allocation for guided missiles](https://arc.aiaa.org/doi/abs/10.2514/6.2025-1907) (joint work with [Torbj&oslash;rn Cunis](https://www.ifr.uni-stuttgart.de/institut/team/Cunis/), [Marc Schneider](https://www.ifr.uni-stuttgart.de/institut/team/Schneider-00019/) and [Walter Fichter](https://www.ifr.uni-stuttgart.de/institut/team/Fichter/))
