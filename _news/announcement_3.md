I will begin my academic journey as a Research Associate at the [Institute of Flight Mechanics and Controls](https://www.ifr.uni-stuttgart.de/) (iFR) at the University of Stuttgart, focusing on robust and scalable control methods for nonlinear flight dynamics to ensure stability, constraint satisfaction, and real-time feasibility of advanced flight control systems.
